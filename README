Not'd

Watch as Matt Janes and Tynan Burke experiment with learning Javascript and browser extensions.

Initial plan:
1) Allow users to take notes on various webpages

Improvements to be done with what we've currently got:
1) Get a custom logo instead of taking some open source thing we forgot to attribute
2) Switch saving from local storage to Google's synced storage
3) Have popup disappear after hitting save
4) Save for each letter typed
5) Have logo change color based on whether or not url has notes associated with it
6) Better handle url parsing, to better multi-page articles, dynamic html, etc, etc.
7) Allow searching of notes
8) Improve UI, make it look nicer, etc.



Potential future improvements I want:
1) Be able to show history of browsing you have done, and how you have tabbed off things, etc.
2) Ability to tag notes to specific parts of a webpage?
